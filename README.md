## Introduction

This lesson plan covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming, essential data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques. The curriculum is designed for full-blown understanding and interview preparation, aiming to provide learners with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in technical interviews.

## Python Fundamentals

### Data Types

- **Primitive Data Types**: Integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
- **Collections**: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- **Type Conversion**: Converting between different data types using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.

### Variables and Operators

- **Variables**: Assigning values to variables using the `=` operator.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`.

### Control Flow

- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **Loops**:
  - **For Loops**: Iterating over a range or collection.
  - **While Loops**: Executing code while a condition is `True`.
- **Loop Control**: Using `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

### Functions

- **Defining Functions**: Using the `def` keyword.
- **Arguments and Return Values**: Passing parameters and returning results.
- **Lambda Functions**: Creating anonymous functions with `lambda`.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that accept other functions as arguments (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes and creating instances.
- **Attributes and Methods**: Adding data and functionality to classes.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes to create specialized versions.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Managing access to data and simplifying complex systems.
- **Polymorphism**: Using methods interchangeably between different classes.

### Modules and Packages

- **Importing Modules**: Using built-in and external modules.
- **Creating Custom Modules**: Organizing code into reusable modules.
- **Virtual Environments**: Managing dependencies with `venv` or `virtualenv`.
- **Package Managers**: Installing packages using `pip`.

## Data Structures

### Arrays and Lists

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size data structures for storing elements of the same type.
- **Lists**: Dynamic arrays in Python, allowing different data types and variable sizes.
- **Basic Operations**: Indexing, slicing, appending, inserting, and removing elements.

### Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked Lists**: Nodes connected in one direction.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Doubly Linked Lists

- **Bidirectional Links**: Nodes have pointers to both previous and next nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used in navigation systems, undo/redo functionalities, and applications that require bidirectional traversal.

### Stacks

- **LIFO Principle (Last In, First Out)**: Data is accessed in reverse order of insertion; the last element added is the first to be removed.
- **Operations**: Includes `push` (add item), `pop` (remove item), and `peek` (view top item).
- **Use Cases**: Utilized in scenarios like function call stacks, expression parsing, and undo operations in text editors.

### Queues

- **FIFO Principle (First In, First Out)**: Data is accessed in the same order as insertion; the first element added is the first to be removed.
- **Operations**: Includes `enqueue` (add item), `dequeue` (remove item), and `peek` (view front item).
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for task scheduling, message processing, and implementing buffers.

### Graphs

- **Vertices and Edges**: Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, which may be directed or undirected.
- **Graph Types**: Can be classified as directed, undirected, weighted (edges have weights), or unweighted.
- **Traversal Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving deeper.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
- **Use Cases**: Widely used in network routing, social networks, search engines, and map-based applications.

### Heaps

- **Heap Property**: In a max heap, the parent node is always larger than the children, while in a min heap, the parent node is smaller.
- **Common Operations**: Insertion, extraction of the max/min element, and heapify operations to maintain the heap structure.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for implementing priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and algorithms like Dijkstra's for finding the shortest path.
